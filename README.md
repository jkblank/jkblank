# Hi, I'm John Klerck

I'm hold a B.SC in Information Technology and am currently completing my B.Sc Honours in Computer Science, focusing on Project Management and Image Processing. 

I usually work with C, C#, Java and Python.

Currently I am working on projects for my studies, and a couple of personal projects.
