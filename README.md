# Hi, I'm John Klerck

I hold a B.SC Honours in COmputer Science and am currently completing my M.Sc in Computer Science, focusing on Project Management and Image Processing. 

I usually work with C, C#, Java and Python.

Currently I am working on projects for my studies, and a couple of personal projects.
